# RamenDesu Project

## Project Structure

The project is organized efficiently for a data science workflow:

- `data/`: Contains the datasets.
  - `raw/`: Immutable original data (e.g., `ramen-ratings.csv`).
  - `processed/`: Cleaned and processed data ready for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation.
- `src/`: Source code for reproducibility (scripts, definitions).
- `models/`: Trained models and model binaries.
- `reports/`: Generated analysis (HTML, PDF, etc.).
- `docs/`: Project documentation.
